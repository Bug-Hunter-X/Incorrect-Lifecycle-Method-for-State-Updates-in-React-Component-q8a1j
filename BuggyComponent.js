This React component uses the wrong lifecycle method for updating the state after receiving new props.  It attempts to use `componentDidMount` which only runs once when the component is initially mounted.  The correct method is `componentDidUpdate` which runs after receiving new props or state changes. This would lead to unexpected behavior, specifically the state not updating correctly after props changes.
